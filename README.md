## 🧰 Task Overview

### 1. **Task 1 –  File Change Monitor (Hash-Checker)**  
- **Description**: A lightweight Python tool to monitor file changes in a directory:  
  - ✅ Detects added, deleted, and modified files.  
  - 🔐 Uses SHA-256 hashing for file integrity checking.

### 2. **Task 2 – XSS Vulnerability Scanner**  
- **Description**: A Python-based XSS scanner that crawls a target website and tests them using a basic XSS payload.
- **Highlights**:
    - 🔗 Recursively crawls links in a domain  
    - 📝 Detects and tests HTML forms for reflected XSS  
    - 🌐 Tests query parameters for GET-based XSS

### 3. **Task 3 – Penetration Testing Toolkit**  
- **Description**: A Toolkit that contains Network-Scanner, Port-Scanner, Http-Sniffer, Spider, Subdomain-Enumeration  
- **Highlights**:  
  - HTTP-Sniffer : captures HTTP traffic over a specified network interface and extracts  
  - Network-Scanner : identifies active devices on a local network using ARP requests  
  - Port-Scanner :  allows to check open TCP ports on a target machine  
  - Spider : recursively crawls a target website and extracts internal links  
  - Subdomain-Enum : allows to find valid subdomains for a target domain  
    - 🔗 [View-Task-3](Task-3)

### 4. **Task 4 – AES-256 File Encryptor/Decryptor**
- **Description**: uses AES-256-GCM to securely encrypt and decrypt files
- **Highlights**:
  - Secure key derivation via PBKDF2
  - Salt/nonce/tag handling with file packaging
  - CLI interface with `argparse`
